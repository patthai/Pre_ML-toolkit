Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Comical as hell; A gesture—a grin. And the house would yell. Uproarious: He was glorious!,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, So from the front. People in the wings Saw him and thought of other things Coldly— Most coldly: Many would say them boldly.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Adding in language without much lace They’d like to break his god-damned face. Ask why? They might be stuck: They would like to. just for luck.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, But these were men. for the greater part. A woman would offer him up her heart Throbbing. On a platter: He could bite it. and it wouldn’t matter.,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, As long as he kissed. and held her tight. And gave her a fairly hectic night. Which he could. And would. A man these women understood!,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Oh yes—Burrs was a charming fellow: Brutal with women. and proportionately yellow. Once he had been forced into a marriage. Unlucky girl! She had a miscarriage,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Two days later. Possibly due To the fact that Burrs beat her     with the hell of a shoe Till her lips went blue. For a week her brother had great fun,36
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Looking for Burrs with a snub-nosed gun: At the end of which time. she began to recover; And Burrs having vanished. the thing blew over. Just a sample For example:,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122,One is probably ample. 2 studio; Bedroom; Bath;,8
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Kitchenette: Furnished like a third act passion set: Oriental; Sentimental; They owed two months on the rental. Pink cushions.,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Blue cushions: overlaid With silk: with lace: with gold brocade. These lay propped up on a double bed That was covered with a Far East tapestry spread. Chinese dragons with writhing backs:,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Photographs caught to the wall with tacks: Their friends in the profession. Celebrities for the impression— (“[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/so's+your+old+man|So’s your old man—Isidore.” “Faithfully—Ethel Barrymore”),23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, On a Chinese lacquer tray there stood a Gong with tassels. and a brass Buddha. Brass candlesticks. Orange candles. An Art vase with broken handles.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Out of which came an upthrusting Of cherry blossoms that needed dusting. Books? Books? My god! You don’t understand.,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, They were far too busy living first-hand For books. Books! True. On the table there lay a few,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Tattered copies of a magazine. Confessional; Professional; That talked of their friends on the stage and screen. A Victrola with records,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Just went to show Queenie’s Art on the man two floors below. Being a person of little guile. He had lent them to her. for just awhile. Believe it or not—,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, All this for a smile! A grand piano stood in the corner With the air of a coffin waiting for a mourner. The bath was a horrible give-away. The floor was dirty:,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, The towels were grey. Cups. saucers. Knives. plates. Bottles. glasses In various states,14
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Of vileness. fought for a precarious space in The jumbled world beneath the basin. The basin top was the temporary home Of a corkscrew. scissors. And a brush and comb.,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, In the basin bowl Was a Pullman towel Vividly wrought with red streaks From Queenie’s perfect lips and cheeks. Behind one faucet. in a stain of rust.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Spattered with talcum powder and dust. A razor blade had lived for weeks. Beside it was a cigarette stub. And the tub? Oh—never mind the tub!,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, On the doorknob there hung a pair Of limp stockings. and a brassiere Too soiled to wear. Of the bedroom. Nothing much to be said.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, It had a bureau: A double bed With one pillow. and white spread. Their trunks: boxes. A chair.,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122,The walls were whte and bare. Only occasional guests slept there: Queenie and Burrs. preferring air. Slept with the Chinese dragons instead. 3,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Sunday noon: Broiling hot. Queenie woke up feeling shot. She lay stretched out on the crumpled bed Naked: slim arms above her head.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, She stared at the ceiling; She stared at her feet; She stared at the clock. And she cursed the heat Faintly:,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Quaintly. She looked exquisite; saintly. Burrs was up. Ugly; silent; Unshaven;,12
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122,     Dressed in a pair of violent Pink pyjamas. badly crumpled. His eyes were pouched. His hair was rumpled. He sat brooding like a captive satyr,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Over a cup and a percolator. He was gross; Morose. The Sunday Tabloid spread before him Rather unusually well supplied,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, With murder. Rape. And suicide. Left him cold: unsatisfied. Even the comics seemed to bore him.,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Queenie lifted her head A trifle from the bed. “Burrsie!” she piped. Her voice was pitched In a fretful key.,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, His mouth twitched: He was dangerously still. By enormous power of will. Her eyes filled with a martyred look: She registered grief. and her voice shook.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, “Burrsie!” Sharply— “Well?” he inquired. “Brrsie! Queenie is oh. so tired!” His teeth snapped.,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, He was glittering-eyed. For a moment or so he could not decide Whether it would be best to throttle Or brain this woman with a nearby bottle. A woman who slept,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Like a corpse under sod. And woke up tired! Almighty God! His nerves jangled. He saw red.,18
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, He said nothing: but Queenie did. From the region of the bed. Peevishly: “Burrsie! Pour out a cup for me!” Said she.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, “The hell I will. you lazy slut! Do you think you’re the Prince of Wales Or what?” Tense Silence. Forboding sudden violence.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Queenie rolled up on to her side. She looked Burrs over. narrow-eyed. Her eyebrows rose On a vicious slant: Her mouth and chin grew adamant.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Burrs was afraid— Already routed. He tried bluster. “Well!” he shouted. Glaring:,13
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, But she simply lay there Staring. So for a long. awkward while. At last she smiled a contemptuous smile At nothing. She yawned. She rose.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, She pulled on a pair of sheer black hose. She rouged her lips. She powdered her nose And kept on going until at last her Flesh to the knees were alabaster.,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Burrs watched. The silence grew. Was the through? Who knew! She thrust one foot,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122,     in a French-heeled shoe. And gave both a critical inspection: Never a look in his direction. The silence chilled his brain. “Queenie!”,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Silence. Again: “Queenie!—Hell!” He was stubborn now: He’d make her talk. no matter how!,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, He set his teeth. Swallowed his pride; Rose: Slunk over: Crouched at her side.,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, “Queenie!” He seized her arm; shook it. She may have been pleased. But she didn’t look it. Her eyes flashed:,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, No truce! She wrenched her am loose. Up she leapt. white faced. He lunged: His arms went around her waist:,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, They tightened: they locked: They crushed her thin. For a moment. she writhed; Then she gave in. He pulled her backwards.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, And her soft. slim Body flew down and covered him. His face was pressed Deep in her breast. She loosened.,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, She waited. She lay still. Giving his hands and lips their will. She was cold as ice. all through it: She had him now.,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, And she knew it. His heart quickened: His breath thickened. She covered his mouth with a kiss like flame; And he quivered; and he gasped;,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, And he almost came. Now. Swift as a snake. She shifted. Her shoulders rose.,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Her arm lifted. Down she struck. His tight embrace Gave. His hands covered his face. She leapt up; fled. with hard laughter.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Bleeding at the mouth. He rushed after. “You rotten bitch! I’ll fix you yet!” She grabbed a knife from the kitchenette.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, And a brown bottle with a whisky label Then dodged swiftly Around the table. They paused: watched:,18
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Animal-eyed. Furious. From either side. Her face was white as though newly plastered. “You touch me—,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, I’ll kill you. you filthy bastard!” The threat was banal. But her tone lent it A quality that showed she meant it. A pause.,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, “Well—?” It was over. “My sweetie’s bats— But I love her!” Said Burrs drily.,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, He smiled wryly. He was wily. Queenie shrugged. and took the cue. “Aw nuts—and to hell with you!” Was her not too sentimental retort.,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, “Come on.” urged Burrs: “be a sport! Go on. Cutie—drop the knife! Let’s call it quits. I like my life!” “Yeah?” said Queenie: “I wouldn’t choose it.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, And once for all. I’ll tell you what: The next time you call me a lazy slut. If I find a knife. I’ll damn well use it!— Kick that idea around till you lose it!” Having delivered herself of this.,41
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, She gave him a condescending kiss. She took a cracked cup from the shelf: Rattled the percolator; Helped herself. Sat.,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Sipped; Perfect lipped. Legs crossed: At ease: engrossed. Beautiful.,10
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, There was a lull. Peace. But her face was still white. And her eyes flickered with angry light. At last she gave an odd,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#122, Double nod. She raised her handsome head; She said: “Burrsie. I think we’re about due For a party:,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART I,poem#123, Don’t you?” Said Burrs: “I do! My god! I haven’t been really tight For a week! Let’s ask the gang to-night!”,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,1 The gang was there when midnight came. The studio was lit by candle-flame; Dim: mysterious: shrouded. Unbidden shadow-guests swarmed,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, About the room. They huddled crowded In every corner; raised deformed Ungainly shoulders. hideous. tall Necks and heads against the wall. Enormous blurred hands kept stealing,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Spider-like. across the ceiling; Crossing with sharp. prismatic masses Of light from swaying spectre glasses. The flames flickered: The shadows leapt:,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They rushed forward boldly; Swept Triumphant Across white faces: Wavered. retreated;,12
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Turned. defeated. And shrank back to darker places. The party was getting underway Stiffly. slowly. The way they drank was unholy.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They hovered around the glass-filled tray Ravenously. Like birds of prey. White. intense; With mask-like faces,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Frozen in rigid. gay grimaces. They chattered and laughed Stony-eyed: Impatient: Hasty:,13
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Preoccupied. They drank swiftly. as though they might Drop dead before they were properly tight. Christ. What a crew!,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Take a look at Madelaine True; Her eyes slanted. Her eyes were green; Heavy-lidded; pouched: obscene. Eyes like a snake’s: Like a stagnant pool,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Filled with slime. Her mouth was cruel: A scar In red. That had recently opened and bled.,18
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Her body was marvellous: A miracle had fused it: The whole world had seen it— And a good part had used it. People bought their seats in advance,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, For fifteen dollars. Glad of the chance To see her dance. Women adored her. Less often. a man:,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And the more fool he— She was Lesbian. Then Jackie: Perfectly formed of face. Slim. elegant.,17

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Once extra for trying to escape. Too bad? Nonsense! He was fun. A good sport:,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The only son Of some unheard-of preacher father Who had kicked him out as too much bother. Of course— (The Black Horse),23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His hips were jaunty. And his gestures too dextrous. A versatile lad! He was ambisextrous. By contrast—Eddie:,18

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And teeth scattered. The bones about his cheeks and eyes Protruded grimly. oversize. A boxer. you’d guess— And right.,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The man could certainly fight. Aggressive; fast; Punishment-proof: Each hand held a kick like a mule’s hoof. He might have been champion—,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He had the cunning: But drink had put him out of the running. Away from the ring. he was easy-going; Good-natured—if sober— And given to blowing.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, But after he’d had his tenth Scotch. A man to be careful of And watch: And when he was mixing gin and rum— A man to keep well away from.,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His woman at present was Mae. She was blonde. and slender. and gay: A passionate flirt. So dumb that it hurt. And better for night than for day.,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Behold the Brothers D’Armano: Otherwise. Oscar and Phil. They sang: They played the piano: They functioned together with skill.,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They lisped. Their voices were shrill. They were powdered. Rouged. Sleek of hair:,14
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They must have worn Pink silk underwear. They clung together with arms laced Each about the other’s waist: Stood around in anguished poses.,24

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, So fast it would take your breath away; And you’d love it. and beg her to let you stay. She had wrecked more homes With lust’s delight Than most women could have,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, With dynamite. She was cute. Lecherous: Lovable. Treacherous:,9
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And about as healthy as a cobra’s bite. “Where the hell is that dirty bum?” Said Queenie: “She swore to God she’d come!” At which point— Bang! on the door.,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Come in!” For answer. came only a high-pitched. Thin Laugh Cut in half,14
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, By a scuffle outside. Silence. “Come in!” The door sprang wide; And there stood Kate.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,     with a man at her side: Both posing Heroic; Mock-dignified. “Ta-da!” sang Kate. clarion-toned: “Well. Ladies,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And what came with you.” she droned— “Meet what brought me in a sea-going hack: The Boy Friend—Mister—Mister— Black! That’s Queenie.,22

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, As she came. she ran her Eyes over Black in professional manner. He was tall; dark; heavy of shoulder: A possible twenty-five. No older.,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Quietly. even soberly dressed; But perfectly groomed—a habit. one guessed. He was carelessly straight. His eyes were bright. His face was tanned. and his smile was white.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His features were sharply cut And clean: He looked sporting: he looked keen. He made you think of squash-rackets; Polo; and yachting;,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And dinner-jackets. And he had that air of poise without pose That only a well-bred person shows. She paused for a second. She looked askance,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, At Burrs: A swift. narrow-eyed glance. She smiled a smile As sharp as a file For the fraction of a while.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Again that odd Slight double nod. The spurs For Burrs! Just what she’d wanted!,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He’d try to rough her. The bastard? Well. now she’d make him suffer! She had planned this party to put him on the rack; And she’d do it by making a play for Black!,35
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Her grey eyes widened: They grew dim. Doubtfully. shyly. she smiled at him. “How do you do. Mr. Black.” said she: “We’re rather informal here.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, As you can see. It was sweet of you to come. I think. Burrsie—mix Mr. Black a drink.” Black said something polite: astonished. Then:,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Please don’t think me rude If I stare— But—your hair—!” “Listen to me. kid!” Kate admonished: “Keep away from that blond-headed vamp:,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She was wise to herself When your ears were damp!” “I haven’t a bit of doubt.” said Black. He grinned at Queenie. And she smiled back—,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, But with eyes dark: engrossed: As though she saw a ghost. Her lashes drooped; made a violet stain Under each eye. like shadows of pain. She held it a second.,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Then semed to recover. It was deftly done— And it got over. Black said nothing. but his clear eyes took On a gentle. understanding look.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Poor Child! Relentless Life had used Her Brutally. and left her Bruised! And beautiful— God! She might have been,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Some legendary fairy queen! She moved off; Left him staring after. Kate burst out in sarcastic laughter. “Well!,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, My God! After all! Queenie takes the brass-lined shawl! My God. though: hasn’t she got the gall. Making a play for you that way!”,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “What do you mean?” said Black: “What play?” “Say kid—I wasn’t born yesterday! I like you. kid; And I know I’m tight.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, But I know what I’m talkin’ about. all right! An’ let me tell you—she’ll get hers If she doesn’t watch her step with Burrs! See? Let her be!,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, I’ve told you—now take it from me!” Black said nothing. but he thought hard. So she lived with Burrs! He was somewhat jarred. He looked Burrs over. and he liked his looks,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, About as well as a fish likes hooks. So this was the man of her choosing? Amusing! His smile grew knowing: His drink grew small:,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,Just a good-looking harlot. after all! 3 The candles spluttered: their flames were gay; And the shadows leapt back out of the way. The party began to get going.,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The laughter rang shriller: The talk boomed louder: The women’s faces showed flush through powder; And the men’s faces were glowing. The room was hung with streamers of smoke.,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, It billowed; curled: Swung; swirled: Poured towards the candle flames And broke. Eyes flashed.,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Glistened: Everyone talked: Few listened. Crash! A glass smashed;,10
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And a woman swore. Shrank back Abashed. On the bed sat a girl. Alone.,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, White: aloof: Like stone. Her mouth was a crimson velvet petal. Her hair was beaten from gun-metal. Her eyes were deeply set,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, In shades of violet. And she sat with never a motion. Like a nun wrapped in devotion. Hungrily Madelaine True eyed her: Slowly she crossed:,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Sank down beside her: Softly she let a hand sink On this girl’s hand. The girl did not shrink: She did not speak:,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She did not stir. She sat staring at a shadow blur That hung like a web to the opposite wall. Gently Madelaine’s fingers slid Upwards along her slender. small,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Ivory arm. The lace that hid The girl’s bosom. rose and quivered: Her petal lips parted: She shivered.,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Slowly she drew her arm away: She rose and went towards the glass-filled tray. Kate hailed Burrs like a long-lost brother. And she left Black’s side To be a red-hot Mother.,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Queenie saw her going: She stopped the Vic. And put on a record so blue it was sick. She moved forward swiftly: She stood before Black:,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Will you dance with me— Until Kate comes back?” And ever so shyly she smiled. He blushed like a ten-year-old child. And nodded. completely beguiled.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, So dance they did. And dance they could: Queenie was a marvel. And the boy was good. Their step was dreamy.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,     and slow. And sweeping: And their rhythm was enough     to set you weeping. They stood up straight.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,     and slim. and tall— None of your sexy stuff at all: Queenie was clever: You should have seen them: She danced as though there,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,     were a sword between them. But the music swerved. It sank into deep Soft murmurs. as though it were falling asleep. Like a dream. the melody began to float,34
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, From a saxophone’s low-pitched. husky throat: And the rhythm whispered with the fierce unrest Of a heart throbbing in a passionate breast. Then Queenie stirred; And the stir went through him;,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And he shifted his arm. And crushed her to him. The shock of her softness     stopped his breath. Lights blurred:,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The floor swam underneath. And Queenie did more than her share: She brushed his lips with her hair: She arched inward: She clung:,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She pressed Her body on his     from knee to breast. It was wonderfully timed. About two steps more.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They’d have lost their balance And fallen on the floor. As it was. the music quavered: Stopped. They disengaged slowly:,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Their arms dropped. And she fed him a blurred.     bewildered glance. She smiled: she whispered: “Our first dance!”,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Let’s get our drinks and sit somewhere.” “Why. yes: if you think Kate wouldn’t care— I don’t want the child to pull my hair!” Queenie took cushions from the double bed. “Do you mind if we sit on the floor?” she said.,43
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, So they found a corner Half-hidden by chair. And they dropped the     cushions. And they sat down there.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Thought Black:     “This is obvious bait: She want to be kissed. Why wait?” His arm went around her:,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He whispered her name. But Queenie was playing a different game. She registered child-like dismay: “No!—Please!”she gasped: “Go away!”,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She pushed him off: averted her head. “I thought you’d be different.” She said. His arm dropped like a shot. He choked,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And his ears turned hot. And he’d thought this woman a prostitute? What a cad he was! What a rotten brute! He stammered:,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “I’m awfully sorry!” he said: “Just awfully— Really! I—lost my head. Please forgive me?”,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She lifted wet eyes. She gave out the faintest of sighs. Then bravely she winked the tears away: Bravely she nodded: She tried to be gay.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She smiled. wistful; She pursed her lips. And blew him a kiss from her finger tips. His soul was torn. It bled.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He wished to God he were dead! Gloomily. he inspected his feet. “You’re the sort I’ve always wanted to meet.” He said: “And now it’s spoiled.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, You probably just think I’mhard-boiled: A rotter: A rounder: A horrible sort of bounder!” Queenie viewed him with large eyes.,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Incredulous: My God—what a prize! “Well.” he said: “I guess I’m through. I’ll go now. if you want me to.” Queenie shook her head.,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She said: “No— Don’t go. You’re really very nice. you know. Please be my friend—,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, I need one so!” His eyes lit with the pleasure Of a man discovering treasure. “There’s nothing I’d rather be!” He told her,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Fervently. Up rose his drink: Up rose her drink. The glasses met with a faint clink. Glass met lip.,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Each took a sip To friendship. Meanwhile. on the double bed. Eyes closed in bliss. Burrs and Kate lay locked,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, In a five-minute kiss. Of course — It meant nothing to either one: They were simply snatching a bit of fun. They stirred:,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They unlocked: They came up for air. Their eyes blurred: The room rocked: They peered here and there.,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Suddenly Kate had a moving thought: “Where’s that cock-eyed bastard I brought?” Her eyes found the corner. And there they stopped. Her head shot forward.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And her jaw dropped. “Well! May Jesus give me grace! He’s mushin’ it up with your angel-face!” “Yeah?” said Burrs.,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He turned to look. His eyes narrowed. and his hands shook. “Yeah?” he said: “So they tell us! Kate winked slyly: “You’re jealous!”,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,“Jealous?” He gave her a glittering stare: “You’re crazy! What the hell do I care!” 4,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The candles flared: the shadows sprang tall. Leapt goblin-like from wall to wall; Excited: Delighted: Mimicking those invited.,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The noise was like great hosts at war: They shouted: they laughed: They shrieked: they swore: They stamped and pounded their feet on the floor: And they clung together in fierce embraces.,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And danced and lurched with savage faces That were wet With sweat: Their eyes were glassy and set. On the bench before the grand piano,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Sat Oscar and Phil: the brother’s d’Armano. They played with fury to the crowd about them: Banged. and sang. And tried to outshout them. They swayed: they bent:,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They hammered on the keys. And shrieked falsetto melodies. Now Jackie stood back of Phil. And his hands just wouldn’t be still! One hand clutched Phil’s shoulder:,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The other was bolder: It ran white fingers through his long black hair. Then fondled his throat. And rested there. Phil’s hands played on with agile grace.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, But he leaned back: Lifted his lily-white face. Jack took it between pink finger-tips: He bent down. and kissed Phil on the lips. Oscar saw.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And his hands went crash On the keys. He leapt up like a flash. His voice rose in a thin shriek: “You kissed him!,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, I saw you—you nasty sneak!” Phil raised his eyebrows: “Well—what if I did?” A groan from Oscar. He sank down. He hid,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His face in his hands. He cried. “There—there!” soothed Phil: He embraced him; He sighed.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, But Oscar jumped up. tragic-eyed. “Don’t you dare touch me!” he shrilled: “Don’t touch me! I’d rather be killed! After all that we’ve been to each other.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, You offer yourself to another! My God! I can’t bear it. I swear it!” The onlookers’ views were varied and divided. And they offered advice,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, To the one with whom they sided. They grinned: Egged them on: Cheered: laughed: derided. Finally Phil:,18
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Go to hell. then. will you?” Cried Oscar: “Oh. you beast!— I’ll kill you!” And he leapt on him. then and there. They slapped:,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They pulled each other’s hair: They sobbed. and panted: Their faces grew smeared With tears and mascara. The crowd cheered:,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Jeered. But Jackie stepped forward: He pushed in between. “Look here.” he said: “you’re making a scene!” Oscar turned on him. streaming-eyed:,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “This is all your fault!” he cried. “I know. Sorry. I didn’t think. Let’s all get together. now. And have a drink; And be gentlemen. instead of boors:,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And you’ll sing us that nice new song of yours!” After much persuasion. they were pacified. They kissed; They sat down side by side. And Jackie rose,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, On the tips of his toes: (How he kept his balance God only knows.) He waved both hands to still the noise: “Be quiet a minute. girls and boys!,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The Brothers d’Armano— (Stand up. boys: bow!) Have a brand-new song; And I’m sure it’s a wow! ‘My Sweetie is Gone’ is the new song’s name.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They will now proceed to sing you the same! And I know right now. it’s going to be grand; Now—! Give these two boys a great big Hand!” They cheered: they whistled:,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They began to clap: And Jackie sat down suddenly in Sally’s lap. The room stood waiting: The room stood still. In the hush.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,     a woman laughed; Drunken: shrill. A chord rang out: turned blue. and ran Through a syncopating vamp. And the song began.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The verse was nothing—but the chorus was Art; And its music was enough to tear you apart: “My Cuddlesome Blond-headed-sweetie,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Is Gone ! (Doggone!) Oh! How,7
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, I wish I had Never been Born! (I told you. Born) She had those,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Kiss-me eyes And lips— What legs! What a pair of hips! I never had,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A sweetie so bad— So glad— So sad— She drove me mad! O-oh—!,14
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, My Adorable Tow-headed cutie Is gone! (She left at dawn),11
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Get out your Handkerchiefs. Brothers and Sisters and— Mourn!,10
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, (I said to M-m-mourn!)” The crown went wild: they swore it a wonder! They roared. And stamped applause like thunder. Even three couples who lay tight-clinched,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, On the bed Stirred A little as they heard. And looked up to see if the place was pinched. “Do it again!,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Encore! Encore!” The Brothers submitted. Came a hush once more. But just as Phil’s fingers were about to light On the keys. a voice came out of the night.,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And the voice was angry. Sepulchral Deep: “Cut out that noise! I want to sleep!” Silence.,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, For a moment’s fraction: The silence of stupefaction. Then they growled; Howled: They took action.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They swarmed to the window Like a subway crush Storming a train in the five o’clock rush. They jostled: Stepped on each other’s toes:,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Elbowed: Clawed: Their voices rose In imprecations. fiercely applied. They thrust grim. furious heads outside.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Night. And against this night. the steep Black neighboring walls Shot up out of sight: Sinister: silent:,18
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Cold. Asleep. They peered up the slanting face of stone. Across the gulf A window shone:,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Square: yellow: And they shrieked— “There’s the fellow!” A man’s figure appeared. Stood set,15
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Against the light in silhouette. Again the voice: “Cut out that noise!” “You bastard! Who the hell are you?” “My god! It’s only half-past two!”,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Pull in your neck!— ” “Go soak your head—!” Were among the more polite things people said. “You’re keeping decent people awake!” “Aw. shut up! So’s your Uncle Jake!”,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Decent?” roared Eddie. “Yes— Decent. I said!” “Come here and I’ll break your lousy head! You cock-eyed son-of-a-bitching scut!,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, D’you think you own this town. or what!” “Yeah? I guess you’re pretty tough!” Said the voice. sardonic: “Now. can that stuff! I’ve asked you decently to stop—,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, If you don’t. I’m going to get a cop!” “You can have your cop. you naughty boy!” Shrilled Mae: and the others roared with joy. “You heard me—!”,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, The silhouette disappeared. The victors cat-called: Hissed: Jeered. The light across the way went out.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They pulled in their heads. They stood about. They grinned. With lurid epithets. They said what they thought of silhouettes.,21
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “He wants t’ sleep. th’ dear sweet bastard!” Sneered Eddie: “That guy ought to be plastered.” “You can have yer cop. see? I told him—” “Yeah! great stuff. kid; that’ll hold him.” “You piped him down. Mae!”,38
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Say. you’re swell!” “‘Be quiet.youse—’! Say!— Let’s raise hell!” Burrs turned.,12
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A group or two away Stood Black and Queenie: Intimate: gay. He stopped: he eyed them. For a minute. a mist seemed to hide them;,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And Queenie’s hand rose; made a white streak Against the tan of the stranger’s cheek. Burrs’ eyes narrowed. His brows met. The palms of his hands grew cold with sweat.,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Then his eyes grew sharp: Bored them. He shouldered his way toward them. “Queenie!” She turned:,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Oh—hello. Burrs.” It was coolly delivered. His mouth quivered. “Queenie! Come here!” She turned white.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Just a minute.” she said to Black: “I’ll be back.” She stepped aside with Burrs. “Well—?” Her tone was as hard as a steel bell.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His stare smouldered. His voice was rough: “Lay off that stuff!” “What stuff? What the hell do you mean! Are you trying to make a scene?” But her eyes glinted:,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Her white cheeks tinted. So Burrs Felt the spurs! Swell! She’d give him a gaudy taste of hell!,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “You know what I mean! Lay off that guy!” “Why?” “Because I tell you to!” “Yeah?—And who the hell are you!” A pause.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Drop it!—It’s the bad news!” Flashed Queenie: “I’ll do what I damn well choose!” “Not if I know it!” He seized her wrist:,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Gave it a twist. She flinched. And made a low wail. Black stepped up: He was ghastly pale:,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He gave Burrs one knife-like glance. Then turned to Queenie: “Would you care to dance?” Burrs watched them go with out-thrust head. He sneered.,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,He joined Kate on the bed. 5 The candles flared: their flames sprang high: The shadows leaned dishevelled. awry: And the party began to reek of sex.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, White arms encircled swollen necks: Blurred faces swam together: locked Red hungry lips: Closed eyes: Rocked.,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, White shoulders burst their ribbon bands; Rose bare to passionate. fumbling hands: White slender throats curved back beneath Attacking mouths that choked their breath. They murmured:,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They gasped: They lurched. and pawed. and grasped. The bed was a slowly moving tangle Of legs and bodies at every angle. Knees rose:,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Legs in sheer stockings crossed. Clung: shimmered: uncrossed: were lost. Skirts were awry. Black arms embraced White legs naked from knee to waist.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Madelaine True and the girl like a nun Lay deep in cushions. locked as one. Madelaine’s uncovered shoulder shone Through gun-metal hair. dully; like bone. The girl’s face was hidden: pressed,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Deep in her slow. uneasy breast. Dolores had broken her comb: She wept to be taken home. She shook off a shoe: She pulled off a stocking:,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A young man joined her. And they sat there rocking. They stared sadly at her scarlet nails. The young man wept. She burst into wails:,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She hid her face on the young man’s shoulder. What could the young man do but hold her? Her nails were his secret passion. He told her. She seemed to believe it.,33
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They clung: They kissed. Shortly. they left together: Unmissed. The bedroom door swung open wide.,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And a girl sauntered out With a man at her side. They kissed. in a matter-of-fact way. And were mildly gay. His suit was badly out of press.,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She tried to smooth her crumpled dress With small success. He pull his tie back in its place: She rouged her lips: She powdered her face.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She rearranged disordered hair. What had been going on in there? Everyone knew Who noticed the two— And nobody seemed to care.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Over blurred keys swung Oscar and Phil. Their hands were numb: They had lost their skill. With faces ashen And smiles set.,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They played a duet. Their fingers slipped: Their fingers stuck. Mangled the jarring notes they struck. They clattered:,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They rumbled; The rhythm was staggered and stumbled. Through all this sound The Victrola kept flinging Dim snatches,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, That had no end. No beginning. Three couples circled Slowly: Clinging.,12
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Back to the room; sprawled on the floor. Black and Queenie sat once more. Drinks stood beside them. They slouched at ease. Her hand rested on his drawn-up knees.,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And this was all right— Quite. When people are sworn friends. All carnal thought ends. Sex is despised:,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, You’d be surprised! So. then. they sat; and his fingers played Gently with the blur her gold hair made. From time to time. they would brush her cheek. Once in a while. each would stare. and smile:,38
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, When the spirit moved them. they would speak. Now Black looked her a soft. adoring kiss. “It seems so queer— Finding you here: Like this.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, It’s wonderful.” He hesitated: shy. “It’s hard to say: I don’t know. You— And I—,16
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And all the noise back there—” (A frown. A stare.) “Perhaps all that’s the world. And we don’t care. Just being here together,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Makes it seem Unreal. somehow. It’s rather like a dream.” She nodded. She closed her eyes. and opened them. Each eye was like a water-misted gem.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She sighed softly. She smiled: “You’re a sweet child—” With eyebrows raised. She shook her head a little. as though amazed.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Again. he scowled: he took a longish drink. “Don’t think me rude— You’re marvellous. I think. You’re much too fine for what’s around this place. This Burrs. f’rinstance.,29
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, I’d like to smash his face! Twisting your arm! He’s yellow. I’d like to bet!” Fiercely he struck A match for her cigarette.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Then Queenie gave him a queer look. Her voice spoke. and her voice shook. “When I first met Burrs. He was grand— You understand?,25
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, As nice as a man could be. He was sweet to me. I was sick. and awfully lonely. And tired. I had no show. And Burrs is the sort who pretends,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He wants to just be friends. I was only sixteen; how could I know?” She shrugged: “It seems ages ago.” Her mouth drooped.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Her lashes fell. “You’ve no idea. I’ve been through hell. What good does it do To say I’m through? Who have I got to turn to?”,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Bravely she smiled. Poor. battered child! Tears filled his eyes to overflowing. He turned his head To keep them from showing.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He cleared his throat: His eyebrows met: “You’ve got me—always! Don’t forget.” “Dear boy!” she whispered.,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Her finger tips Rose in his hand. and met his lips. From time to time. lying on the bed With Kate. Burrs raised a dishevelled head And scowled at blurred gold hair on a pair,36
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Of wavering knees. The edge of the chair Cut off the rest. What went on there! Burrs trembled: He felt sick.,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He ached for a bottle. a whip. a stick: He’d batter that bastard green and blue Before he was through! And Queenie too! “Lie still. Burrsie!”,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,Kate’s hand pressed His hot head back against her breast. 6 The candle flames stood stiff and tall: And the shadows lay overlapped on the wall.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A candle guttered; its flame died: The shadows rushed in from every side; A sinister. swift procession. Taking grim possession. The noise dropped to a strange. jumbling.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Low-pitched sound. like distant mumbling. Over this blur the Victrola threw Incessant music. soft and blue. Under the grand piano were curled Oscar and Phil. dead to the world.,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They sprawled like corpses. Their pinched faces Showed ghastly white in unrouged places. “Everyone elsh’s awful tight: Yessir!”,19
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Said Jackie. “As f’r me. could drink all night. Yessir!” Said Jackie. “Mix ’em. too! Gin. wh-whisky. wine—,19

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Her skirt and pull it down to her knees. Mae rushed forward: “Eddie!” But he was there already. His hand swept down; his grip grew tight,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, On the man’s neck. His knuckles showed white. His shoulders heaved. With one drag He pulled the man up like a limp rag. The man’s head rolled from side to side:,32

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His fist drew back. Shot out. struck With a dull smack. Back went the man’s head:,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He spun where he stood: He fell flat. and lay there. His face oozing blood. The bystanders murmured in awe. Eddie thrust out his jaw.,26
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A woman laughed: His ear caught the sound: He snarled. Ducked his head. Swung swiftly around.,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Who yer laughin’ at. yuh tart! I’ll break yer god-damned face apart!” His lips curled. and his fang-like teeth Gleamed crooked and savage underneath. His shoulders began to twist.,30

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He stood there With dishevelled hair: Feet apart; shoulders stooping; Hands in his pockets; head drooping: Furious:,18
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, White: His eyes had a glittering light. Queenie joined Black: They came his way. Burrs stiffened. and his face grew grey.,22

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, To shoulder Black aside. But Black stood rigid: cut from rock; And Burrs recoiled. Staggered from the shock. Then they passed on:,23
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Not a word. As though nothing at all had occurred. Burrs raised clenched fists— But his guts turned hollow. He watched them go.,24
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And he dared not follow. He shook. His face began to twitch: “I’ll fix you plenty. you son of a bitch!” In a corner. a group well under the weather,31

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A huge shadow moved to and fro. The shadow sharpened. Shrank. Made A clear black image on the shade.,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,In pantomime. a man was shown Talking over a telephone. 8 Black took a drink as they passed the table: A long one:,23

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, So he poured it out. and he took it. His head buzzed; and he shook it. “Let’s go sit.” he suggested: “Let’s talk.” It became somewhat of a problem to walk.,32
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, They moved around the corner chair With care. He stumbled over a leg: “I beg—” He lapsed a second:,20
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, He shook his head. Recovered: “I beg your pardon!” he said. Queenie’s giggle was delicious. Light.,17
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Oh. I’m all right.” He said: “Quite!— But I think I must be tight!” The words seemed out before he could speak:,23

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Having just met her! With a sigh. she settled her head on his knees And wriggled a little. till she felt at ease. She smiled. “Don’t let’s talk.” she said:,31
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, “Let’s be quiet for a while instead.” So there was silence there. His fingers played through her golden hair. She closed her eyes. Her head swirled.,27
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Music came faintly from another world. She forgot Burrs: Her revenge grew dim. This man wanted her. And she,20

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Then suddenly came     to rest With its palm pressed Soft and hot on the pulse     of her slender throat.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, She gave a sound like a sob. Her body began to throb. Some wire inside her broke     with a snap. And her head slid slowly,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123,     to his lap. For a while. they were motionless: Flushed: Hushed. Slowly the air about them became,22
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Too thick to breathe: Heated by flame. Their hearts pounded till their brains shook: Blood roared through their veins like a swollen     brook.,28
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, His fingers ached To feel fresh. Cool flesh. His hand waked. It discovered her shoulders:,16

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, Tight-pressed. Then she raised her head and shook it. She rose to her knees. Put a hand out: He took it.,22

Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, And the air was strangely fresh and sweet. They stood blinking: They swayed on their feet; And blank silence wrapped them in. Little by little the dark grew thin.,30
Poet_8,non-suicidal,>>PART II,poem#123, A window glimmered with faint light: The bed made a dim. soft blur of white. They lurched forward. Stumbled round a chair. Staggered to the bed,27
