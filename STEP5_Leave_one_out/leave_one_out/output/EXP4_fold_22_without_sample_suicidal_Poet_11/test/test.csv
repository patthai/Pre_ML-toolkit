 Lie down for ever. all my sayings said – Deeds all done and songs all sung. While others chant in sun and rain. ‘Heel and toe from dawn to dusk. Round the world and home again.’,suicidal
 Death will come and she'll have your eyes – This death which escorts us From dawn till dusk. sleepless. Deaf. like an ancient regret Or an absurd habit. Your eyes,suicidal
 Will be an empty word. A stifled scream. a silence. Thus you see them every morning When you fold yourself Into the mirror. O dear hope.,suicidal
 That day. we too will know That you are life and you are nothing. Death has a look for everyone. Death will come and she'll have your eyes. It will be like quitting a habit.,suicidal
 Like seeing a dead face Re-emerge from a mirror. Like listening to a closed lip We will descend into the gorge. soundless.,suicidal
 She stands there before me. a lean. unsmiling girl. watching me. And those great transparent eyes have seen other things. They still see them. They are those things. Wild berry and wild beast are in her eyes. and the howling. the death. the cruel turning,suicidal
 of the flesh to stone. I know the spilled blood. the torn flesh. the voracious earth. and solitude. For her. the wild one. it is all solitude. For her the wild animal is solitude. Her caresses are like the caresses one gives a dog or a tree. But. stranger. she looks at,suicidal
 me. looks at me - a lean girl in a short tunic. like a girl from your own village.,suicidal
