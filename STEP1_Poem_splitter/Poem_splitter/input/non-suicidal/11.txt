>>NIGHT OF SHOOTING STARS
I go back up to the hills
(they shimmer with wheat bent by the August breeze).
Silvestro, dear friend, you deliver me
To all things past, to the stress and toil
That wears the stone smooth over the grain,
And you offer me a leaf in your generous
Hand. You stand inside
The young moon’s lazy halo
Talking about all the right things.
The crisp wind flickers in your eyes
And harness bells jangle on the hilltops.
The enchanted crowds I saw ablaze
Are the lights of San Lorenzo. You laugh
When I ponder the long trail
Of ants you’re burning.

>>THE DISTANCE
The distance between things around me
changes every year
even if I’m nailed in place,
even if things don’t move.
