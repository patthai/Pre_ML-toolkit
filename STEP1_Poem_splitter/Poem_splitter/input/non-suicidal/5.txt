>>October Poem
Crisis is my nature
There is a fierce hurricane of feelings
under my smooth skin       There is
a fresh corpse thrown up
on the desolate shore of October

      October is my Empire
      My delicate hands control things to be lost
      My small eyes watch things that are to disappear
      My soft ears listen to the silence of people who are to die

Fear is my nature
The Time that murders everything
flows in my rich blood       There is
a new hunger trembling
in the cold sky of October

      October is my Empire
      My dead armies occupy all cities where rain falls
      My dead patrol planes circle in the sky above the lost souls
      My dead mobs sign their names for the people who are going to die



>>The Way Home
I shouldn't have learned a language
A world without words
How good it would be
If I lived in a world where meaning does not become meaning

Even if you are revenged by beautiful words
It       has nothing to do with me
And even though you shed blood for some quiet meaning
It has nothing to do with me either

The tears that are in your tender eyes
The pain that is falling from the tongue of your silence
If there were no words in our world
I would merely stare at it and leave

Is there as much meaning       in your tears
as there is in the core of a piece of fruit
Is there an echo of the sunset       in one drop of your blood
which makes you tremble in the twilight of this world

I shouldn't have learned a language
Simply because I learned Japanese and bits of foreign languages
I stand still inside your tears
I return absolutely alone into your blood



>>Withered Leaves
and
they died       without even shedding green
blood

before they return to the soil
they change to the color of soil
the color of
the silence that has died one death

why does everything
seem transparent       even though we walked endlessly
through the border       of day and night
through the withered leaves

a man
whose star is fixed
does not turn back


>>Fly
What kind of dream do you have
when you wake up
Are you being chased
to the end of the earth by a blue lion?
or do you drift while you drink golden whiskey
in the arms of a dead man?

Morning       the bell of a hung over telephone rings
You stretch out your leaden arms
Oh       I wasn't having such bad dreams
the blue lion and
the golden whiskey

At the moment you wake up
things that go to sleep for the first time inside you
you see only in dreams
I cannot say it well but
at a certain moment in a man's life
there is even a dream
where you cannot see the horizon on land or sea


>>The Light at Thirteen Second Intervals
I don't like new houses
It may be because I was born and raised in an old house
There is neither a dinner table to share with the dead
nor space for a sentient being to grow
It was maybe twenty years ago that
I wrote in a poem
"a pear tree split"
I planted a pear tree again
on the small lot of this new house
Morning       Watering it is my job
I want to grow death
at least inside of the pear tree
At night I read Victorian pornography
My only illusion is
"I have no illusions about the future"
Yet, at that moment there is a light
on the horizon forty kilometers outside my window
A light from the lighthouse at Oshima Island
at thirteen second intervals


>>1999
I heard talk about ants somewhere
I firmly believed that the ant is a symbol of industriousness
That is completely wrong
for example
out of ten
only one is diligently carrying food
the other nine just wander around back and forth and left and right
I hear
pretending to be very busy
full of vitality
and being lazy

I want to become an ant, too
joining the group of nine
Sometimes
I should make an ideological scream

And
what is more surprising
is the ant's sleeping habits

They are awake only two hours
and spend a good twenty two hours asleep
1999

I want to publish a book of poems by that name
if I can survive that long
it will be a full eighteen years       I

will remain asleep like the ants
I want to write a diagnosis of the mental abnormality
of the one that silently continues carrying the food

Today's work is over
so
good night


>>While I Can Still See
The light of stars
The flowers in the fields
The horizon at sea rolled back
The horizon on land upside down
There is a face under the hat
if I open a door someone is there
a bird's feather
a small animal's footprints
carved in snow
the rapid descent of the evening sun in autumn
the hazy moon in spring

I once wrote
"Time does not expire
People expire"

I've seen any number of people expire
and I
will expire in the end

I can see
but what in the world did my eyes see

Only time


>>The Cherry
A mountain cherry tree        in the forest covered with dark and light young leaves
after looking at the petals I go out to town
The cherry trees in town
have been created by human hands from natural cherry trees
In the small garden at my house
a Yoshino cherry stands quite stately
At its roots wild birds and cats       that lived eighteen years
are buried
and in those cherry blossoms
the light of death and the sadness of life dwell


>>Bird Language
I don't think
anybody has seen my footprints
no matter what sand beach washed by waves
no matter what desert assaulted by sand storms
no one can understand the meaning
even if they hear the words
so the words are
nothing but bird language
Small birds come up to me, but
eagles and hawks just watch cautiously
with their sharp eyes from high up in the sky
Even though my Japanese language is clear
no one responds       A few did
but they're all dead

My meals are simple
If there is a little cheese and red wine, that will be enough
People say nicotine prevents senility
so less than ten light cigarettes

As for reading       lying down on a wooden bed
I read the world's miserable stories and histories
and as I read I fall asleep
When I open my eyes it's a refreshing morning
I put in my clean false teeth
and open the morning paper
It doesn't matter to me
whether the dollar goes down or the yen goes up
It's nice if there is a report of an interesting murder

There is even a smell of religion
in the human behavior called murder
There is no chance of a drama exactly like sex being born in the Holocaust
of one human being poisoning other human beings or shooting them
and asserting an alibi       Speaking of which I remember a foreign movie called
"Murder Without Passion"
My epitaph is decided
carved on the stone in the forest in bird language
"My life was beautiful"
