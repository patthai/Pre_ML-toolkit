>>On A Tight Rope with William Faulkner
 
 
There are some kinds of writing,
Malcolm Cowley quotes William Faulkner as saying,
That have to be done very fast
Like riding a bicycle on a tight rope.
 
And sometimes there are crowds below
To cheer and clap, the echoes
Bouncing from the tent’s top.
 
But many times there is nothing below,
Just sawdust on the floor,
And sometimes in the throat.

>>Portrait
 
 
She spoke of things of long ago—
They were as yesterday.
She told of a dream:
It was a September
And it was not really warm until noon.
I had been sitting in the sun, she said.
I could hear a crow across the field.
On the trellis there were new roses.
   I was sitting in the sun,
   And he brought me three fresh pears
       from the tree in the far pasture.


>> An Old Lady Sits by the Window and Knits
 
 
Esoterically speaking
Shadows decline
Casting pale shadows
On pale hands
That move in and out,
Saying with sad finality,
All is finished.
And yet hoping, as the eyes speak,
Watching glittering goldfish
Swim languidly in the sun.


>>A Country Saga
 
 
They carried him home in the late August,
And all through the warm days of September
He lay with two broken legs.
Then with the cool nights of October
Came the fever,
And in the haze of the autumn he died.
 
They buried him in the weed-grown graveyard,
While his father hobbled, dry-eyed, to gaze.
The next day they turned his bed to the sun,
And the smoke of the evening came home to rest.
The old man sat on the porch and smoked.
“It will rain tonight,” he said.


>>“The Prophet”
 
 
He has grown quieter now,
And almost forgotten—
The Prophet
Only comes to town at tobacco-market time,
And he’s only moved to preach
When pimply faced boys snicker
At his long gray beard and high black hat.
He’ll roar at them then,
Damnation and spittle directed at their faces.
 
But there was a time—yes, there was a time—
When they would not have laughed.
There was a time when he stood in the street
With eyes lifted to an August sun
And hellfire pouring from his lips,
Throwing their sins out for all to see.
The poor bastards who felt that hell could be no hotter
Than the tobacco rows down which they marched—
But sin was real and damnation sure,
And the Prophet knew where
To hit them where it hurt.
He could preach for an hour, two hours,
And they would listen,
Scuffing the dirt and never hunting shade
Until the Prophet had poured out his scorn
And walked away.
 
The old man’s fire is gone now.
He dozes in the shade of the mulberry tree
And mumbles to himself, brushing flies from his face—
Hell is far away,
Beyond the cornfield, the cotton patch,
And maybe even beyond the dusty towns of long ago.

>>Deserted House
 
 
He went out at dusk,
    out from the house
That stood beyond the little patch
    of pine, where honeysuckle
    grew along the ground, and a large boulder
    reared, and around it
    the path circled.
He went out at dusk,
    and there was a whippoorwill’s cry
From the dark wood and across the fields
    now broken with October.
Somewhere . . . somewhere. He did not know . . .
And the woman who saw him go
Knew that he would not be back.
She left the door open
    and night crept in,
    and when she had gone,
    how many days, weeks, or months had gone by . . .
The sunlight slanted across the floor
And a curious squirrel left tracks in the dust.


>>Neighbors
 
 
I imagine he got rather lonely
Living that far from town
With no neighbors close enough
To drop by at night for a smoke and talk.
And living alone gives time for too much thought—
It’s that way especially at night.
 
The time I saw him he was standing in front
Of his little house on the hill
Watching our train as it passed by.
He waved at us
And I fancy that meant something to him—
Waving at the train as it passed each day.
It was morning then and the man probably
Spent the rest of the day walking
Under the trees around his house.
 
But at night he doesn’t have much
Except the wind to listen to
And a fire to nurse along
Until it’s time to go to bed.
In the morning he can watch for the train
And wave at us as we go by.


>>Man in Time
 
 
He was afraid of storms
    and hid in culverts or potato houses
    when they came in.
Sometimes he grew a beard,
    in summertime, too—a red beard—
    and went for weeks without talking.
Once I saw him plowing past midnight
    in a full moon,
    crying out at the far turn
    to a sleepy horse
    that stumbled in the dark—
    strange sounds of gee, haw and goddamn
   in broken words across broken ground.
Then he would be gone
    in polished shoes, shaven,
    and wearing a panama hat.
No words for days.
And then smoke from the chimney
    and wild curses for the cat, for the dog, for the land,
    and for the man.


>>Home is the Hunter
 
 
He stares from a window in a darkened room
At moonrise over hills where
The full cry of hounds is heard.
His fingers smooth the warm cane wood
As shadows play across floor and face.
His ear follows the fading hunt
Beyond the woods, under silent stars.
 
He sits alone.
    A dog barks in a distant yard.
    A night bird calls,
    And the cricket resumes his cry.


>>Two
 
 
In the old house they sat alone—
    The rain in the trees
    Is hidden by darkness.
And hidden, too, are hoarded griefs
Forgotten now as to why or how.
    Still—
    Silent faces turn
    To a watchful clock,
    Crying to time:
Tell me, Tell me.


>>A Dance and Death from My Window
 
 
It was a little dance before death
On the stone steps of an April morning.
I saw him from the window—
A swinging of arms, and then the quick jig.
The days were few and then the wreath
Hung on the door.
A man brought flowers and she stood weeping,
He twisted his hat in his hands,
And she dabbing at eyes,
Saying something I could not hear.
Some rites the dead demand,
And they were done.
The street was quiet again—
The lilac bloomed.
And on a lazy afternoon
A long lean cat stalked
A singing bird.


>> Postwar
 
 
He came home from Petersburg,
Footing it down the road with three others
Who fell off by the way,
He going the last miles alone.
The chimney’s smoke quickened his steps.
She was waiting in the doorway
And ran down the path to meet him.
Not much was said:
They walked back together
And he took off his hat and stood a moment
Before going in to supper.
 
He cleaned the spring,
And there were three places in the fence to mend.
A new ground was cleared,
And after the plowing was done,
Along the road he planted a row of cedars.
