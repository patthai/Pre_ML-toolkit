>>Bread

Wheat is still. It makes no sound
As it pushes from the ground.

As it runs its slow, serene
Course in rows of tender green.

Wheat is quiet; as it grows
It only whispers what it knows.

Wheat is mute--till it is fed
To children as a loaf of bread.

Then it is laughter; it is song;
It is clamor all day long.


>>Butter
Butter is music of wind that passes
Through blue alfalfa and supple grasses

It is sun on meadows; it is lyric notes
Of rain and honey in clover throats.

It is the pale gold rhythmic tread
Of summer on a slice of bread.

>> Haying
The supper bell was ringing as Neil strode- -
A bucket of warm milk in either hand;
The cat and her five kittens at her heels- -
Down through the yellow tansy in the lane
Where Tod and I were washing in the trough-- -
We'd laid the pipe last summer from the hills - -
And said, his weather eye cocked toward the south,
"We're in for rain by morning. The wind has changed.

So we'll be finishing the hay tonight."
Tod lifted his black curly head, from which
The bright drops splashed, and glared at Neil - -
Aw, have a heart, big boy. I've worked enough
For two farmlands today, and there's a dance
At Mary's Corners, Neil, I have a date . . .
The crickets fiddled in the dusty grass . . .
I looked away. What could a fellow do?

And Nancy'd promised she would go with me . . .
Neil turned and went on slowly to the house.
His shirt was stained across the back with sweat;
He looked dog-tired. We all were. We'd been up
And in the hay fields since long before dawn - -
How endless-long, the murky day had seemed!
How hot! And how the green deer flies had stung!

And then I was remembering the frought - -
Those dreadful years with scarce a drop of rain,
When Neil had almost lost Glenacres, and
Had shot a herd of starving blood stock.
And we'd gone hungry too. "We'd better stand
By Neil," I said. "A crop of hay means cash.
And cash means we will go to college, see?"

But Tod was mad - - you couldn't blame him much - -
"Don't be a fool!" he snapped. "Neil thinks because
We're kids that he can run us." Then Maurine - -
Neil's wife: she's kind of little-like and thin
From over-work and worry, but sure good
To Tod and me - - we'd lived with her and Neil
Since Dad and Mother died - -Maurine then called,
"Your suppers's hot and waiting. Come and get it, boys."

So when we'd wiped upon the roller-towel
Beside the kitchen door, we dragged our chairs
Up to the table, where already Neil
Was eating. We piled our plates with fried new spuds,
Thick pork gravy, cobs of early corn,
And passed the blue glass dish of fireweed honey - -
We kept our hives far up the old hill burn - -
Hot biscuits get blue ribbons at the Fair - -
And no one talked, till, belts let out a notch,
Our chairs tipped back against the wall, Neil said,
As he lit his pipe, "What about it, kids?"

Maurine's brown eyes were pleading,  go with him - -
Not even Tod could quite withstand that glance;
So like bull-yearlings bunting at a fence
We charged the telephone. Tod got there first.
When he'd called off his date, I rang Nancy - -
Nan's pretty as crab apple blossoms, and as slim
As any alder tree, She dances too
Like willows swaying in April wind - -
But Nancy Saunders comes of farmer stock:
"Next week, then, Karl," she said, "when haying's done."

Neil had the big greys hitched up to the rick
When we ran to the barn. So Tod and I
Climbed in the back and sat with dangling heels
As Prince and Nelly ambled down the lane
Between the daisies and the Bouncing Bet.

It was a different world from afternoon,
The air as yellow-cool as buttercups.
The sun had set; the sky, no longer fiery-blue,
Was fleeced with lamb's wool clouds, and these
Were finged with wild rose pink. I looked at Tod
And Neil, and wondered if they noticed too.

I couldn't see Neil's features, but his back
Looked rested-like. Tod sort of sighed, and chewed
A clover stalk . . . and when a t last we slide
The creaking gate bars out, and rattled in
The west-end meadow - - the sightliest spot
In all Glenacres any time of day - -
It was so beautiful now in the dusk
That something caught me in the throat
Like Christmas carols on the radio . . .

Long purple shadows from the fir trees lay
Across the cocks stubble. It was so still
That we could hear the falls of Cedar Creek . . .
A wood thrush in the hazel bushes piped
One sweet high note; an owl called to his mate;
White foxgloves glowed like candles by the fence.

In place of choking dust, there now was dew.
As Tod and I forked up the hay to Neil,
Who stacked as fast as two of us could pitch,
The fragrance made me think of Nancy's hair . . .

With every load, the magic grew. A star
Rose in the west . . . We worked with scarce a word.
Oh, it was like our church with hymns and prayers
On Sunday when the riding parson comes.

Then as we took the last road in, the moon
Came up behind the hill, and Tod and Neil
And I, the horses and the meadows, all
Were silvered with its light, and suddenly
I was as far away from Tod, as if
I swam across a lake and left him,
My own brother, on the farther shore.
My heart cried out, but there was no reply . . .
Between a field and hayloft, I grew up . . .

Toward morning I half-awakened to a sound
Of raindrops pelting on the attic roof.


>>No April Words

There are no words for saying
How wistful is the push
Of April through the budding
Of a lilac bush.

There are no notes for making
A little elfin air
Of new leaves on a willow;
No phrases to compare

With tapering blue hyacinths;
The first white butterfly;
Of plum trees misted sudden
Silver on the sky...

One may only listen-
Hand at throat-to rapture
More lyrically lovely
Than any song may capture.

>>October

Summer is a tang of water-cress
On my mouth,
The dust of rose petals.
Birds press south.
Tomorrow - or perhaps tomorrow -
There will be snow.
Winds know,
Zinnias know
And I -
Why must there be for me
Only the way back,
Or on?
There is this quiet day,
This yellow tree...


>>Of Bonfires

What dreams are dreamed in the pungency
Of smoke that wings from driftwood debris.
Faces illumed by the jeweled light
Will be recalled a lonelier night,
While hearts transcribe the peace of a dune
On a burnished disk of rising moon.

>>Slippers

When I was young
And my slippers were red
I could kick higher
Than my own head.

When I grew up
And my slippers were white
I could dance the stars
Right out of the night.

Now I am old!
My slippers are black;
I walk to the corner
And I walk back


>>To A Girl Poet With A Lover
Girl with a Gift, you cannot be
Both love of Love and Poesy.

Love love, dear child, and you will find
Constancy and peace of mind.

Become mistress of the Muse;
He will play you fast and loose.

(Sons of young love should be strong;
Certain-frail, a first-born song.)

Love will be the counterpart
Of a steadfast, gentle heart.

Muse is passionate and bold,
Blowing hot and blowing cold.

Love will wrap you in a shawl;
Muse will bare you, soul and all.

If I dared, I'd say "Forget!
Forget the Muse!" -- and yet-- and
yet--


 >>To My Little One

 I, your guiding star? Ah, no.
You, the light by which I go-
The candle with the bright, small wick,
Whereof I am the candlestick.
In His wisdom, One once said,
"By a child you shall be led."
(I had no way of knowing how
Beautiful this truth, till now.)
O precious little beacon, burn
Along my course, until I learn
In all humility to be
Splendid as your faith in me.

>> Who Knows a Mountain?

Who knows a mountain?
One who has gone
To worship its beauty
In the dawn;
One who has slept
On its breast at night;
One who has measured
His strength to its height;

One who has followed
Its longest trail,
And laughed in the face
Of its fiercest gale;
One who has scaled its peaks,
And has trod
Its cloud-swept summits
Alone with God.
