>> Voy a dormir

Teeth of petals, bonnet of dew,
handfuls of herbs, oh sweet nursemaid,
turn the earthly sheets down for me
and prepare my quilt of  carded moss.

I’m going to sleep, my nursemaid—lay me down;
put a lamp on the nightstand for me,
or a constellation, whichever you like—
both are fine; turn the lights down a bit.

Now leave me alone and hear the buds break …
as you’re rocked by a heavenly foot from above,
and a bird zigzags you a path

so that you can forget … Thank you. Oh, a favor:
if he calls again
tell him not to insist, for I have gone away …

>> To Eros

I caught you by the neck

on the shore of the sea, while you shot

arrows from your quiver to wound me

and on the ground I saw your flowered crown.

I disemboweled your stomach like a doll's

and examined your deceitful wheels,

and deeply hidden in your golden pulleys

I found a trapdoor that said: sex.

On the beach I held you, now a sad heap,

up to the sun, accomplice of your deeds,

before a chorus of frightened sirens.

Your deceitful godmother, the moon

was climbing through the crest of the dawn,

and I threw you into the mouth of the waves.

>> To My Lady of Poetry

I throw myself here at your feet, sinful,

my dark face against your blue earth,

you the virgin among armies of palm trees

that never grow old as humans do.

I don't dare look at your pure eyes

or dare touch your miraculous hand:

I look behind me and a river of rashness

urges me guiltlessly on against you.

With a promise to mend my ways through your

divine grace, I humbly place on your

hem a little green branch,

for I couldn't have possibly lived

cut off from your shadow, since you blinded me

at birth with your fierce branding iron.
