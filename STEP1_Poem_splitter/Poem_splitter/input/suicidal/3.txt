>>Moon's ending

Moon, worn thin to the width of a quill,
In the dawn clouds flying,
How good to go, light into light , and still
Giving light, dying.

>>Wisdom

When I have ceased to break my wings 
Against the faultiness of things, 
And learned that compromises wait 
Behind each hardly opened gate, 
When I have looked Life in the eyes, 
Grown calm and very coldly wise, 
Life will have given me the Truth, 
And taken in exchange--my youth. 

>>Autumn on the Beaches

Not more blue at the dawn of the world,
Not more virgin or more gay,
Never in all the million years
Was the sea happier than to-day.

The sand was not more trackless then,
Morning more stainless or more cold—
Only the forest and the fields
Know that the year is old.

>>Advice To A Girl

No one worth possessing 
Can be quite possessed; 
Lay that on your heart, 
My young angry dear; 
This truth, this hard and precious stone, 
Lay it on your hot cheek, 
Let it hide your tear. 
Hold it like a crystal 
When you are alone 
And gaze in the depths of the icy stone. 
Long, look long and you will be blessed: 
No one worth possessing 
Can be quite possessed.

>>Even to‑day

What if the bridge men built goes down,
What if the torrent sweeps the town,
The hills are safe, the hills remain,
The hills are happy in the rain.

>>Grace Before Sleep

How can our minds and bodies be
Grateful enough that we have spent
Here in this generous room, we three,
This evening of content?
Each one of us has walked through storm
And fled the wolves along the road;
But here the hearth is wide and warm,
And for this shelter and this light
Accept, O Lord, our thanks to-night.

>>All that was mortal

All that was mortal shall be burned away,
All that was mind shall have been put to sleep.  
Only the spirit shall awake to say
What the deep says to the deep;
But for an instance, for it too is fleeting—
As on a field with new snow everywhere,
Footprints of birds record a brief alighting
In flight begun and ended in the air.

>>There Will Be Rest
There will be rest, and sure stars shining
Over the roof-tops crowned with snow,
A reign of rest, serene forgetting,
The music of stillness holy and low.
I will make this world of my devising
Out of a dream in my lonely mind.
I shall find the crystal of peace, – above me
Stars I shall find.

>>Return to a Country House

Nothing but darkness enters in this room,
Nothing but darkness and the winter night,
Yet on this bed once years ago a light
Silvered the sheets with an unearthly bloom;
It was the planet Venus in the west
Casting a square of brightness on this bed,
And in that light your dark and lovely head
Lay for a while and seemed to be at rest.

But that the light is gone, and that no more
Even if it were here, would you be here,-
That is one line in a long tragic play
That has been acted many times before,
And acted best when not a single tear
Falls,- when the mind and not the heart holds sway.
