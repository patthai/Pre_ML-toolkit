>>Death will come and she'll have your eyes

Death will come and she'll have your eyes â€“
This death which escorts us
From dawn till dusk, sleepless,
Deaf, like an ancient regret
Or an absurd habit. Your eyes
Will be an empty word,
A stifled scream, a silence.
Thus you see them every morning
When you fold yourself
Into the mirror. O dear hope,
That day, we too will know
That you are life and you are nothing.

Death has a look for everyone.
Death will come and she'll have your eyes.
It will be like quitting a habit,
Like seeing a dead face
Re-emerge from a mirror,
Like listening to a closed lip
We will descend into the gorge, soundless.

>> The Wild Beast
She stands there before me, a lean, unsmiling girl,
watching me. And those great transparent eyes have
seen other things. They still see them. They are
those things. Wild berry and wild beast are in her
eyes, and the howling, the death, the cruel turning
of the flesh to stone. I know the spilled blood, the
torn flesh, the voracious earth, and solitude. For
her, the wild one, it is all solitude. For her the wild
animal is solitude. Her caresses are like the caresses
one gives a dog or a tree. But, stranger, she looks at
me, looks at me - a lean girl in a short tunic, like a
girl from your own village.
