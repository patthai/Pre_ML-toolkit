>>Past One O’Clock

Past one o’clock you're probably in bed
The Milky Way is like Oka of silver
No need for me to rush I have no reasons left 
to stir you with the lightnings of my cable fever
And so they say the incident dissolved*
the love boat smashed up on the dreary routine
We’re even there’s no use in keeping the score 
of mutual hurts affliction and spleen
Look here the world exudes an eerie calm
The night demands tribute in constellations
in hours like these I’d like to be the one
with ages history and the creation

>> At the Top of My voice

My most respected
comrades of posterity!
Rummaging among
 these days’ 
 petrified crap,
exploring the twilight of our times,
you,
possibly,
will inquire about me too.

And, possibly, your scholars
 will declare,
with their erudition overwhelming
 a swarm of problems;
once there lived
a certain champion of boiled water,
and inveterate enemy of raw water.

Professor,
 take off your bicycle glasses!
I myself will expound
 those times
 and myself.

I, a latrine cleaner
and water carrier,
by the revolution
 mobilized and drafted,
went off to the front
from the aristocratic gardens 
of poetry - 
 the capricious wench
She planted a delicious garden,
the daughter,
 cottage,
 pond
and meadow.

Myself a garden I did plant,
myself with water sprinkled it.
some pour their verse from water cans;
others spit water
from their mouth - 
the curly Macks,
 the clever jacks - 
but what the hell’s it all about!
There’s no damming al this up - 
beneath the walls they mandoline:
“Tara-tina, tara-tine,
tw-a-n-g...” 
It’s no great honor, then,
for my monuments
to rise from such roses
above the public squares,
where consumption coughs,
where whores, hooligans and syphilis
walk.

Agitprop
 sticks
 in my teeth too,
and I’d rather
 compose
 romances for you - 
more profit in it
and more charm.

But I
 subdued
 myself,
setting my heel
on the throat
 of my own song.
Listen,
 comrades of posterity,
to the agitator
 the rabble-rouser.

Stifling
 the torrents of poetry,
I’ll skip
 the volumes of lyrics;
as one alive,
I’ll address the living.
I’ll join you
 in the far communist future,
I who am
 no Esenin super-hero.

My verse will reach you
across the peaks of ages,
over the heads
of governments and poets.

My verse 
 will reach you
not as an arrow
in a cupid-lyred chase,
not as worn penny
Reaches a numismatist,
not as the light of dead stars reaches you.

My verse
by labor
 will break the mountain chain of years,
and will present itself
ponderous, 
 crude,
tangible,
as an aqueduct,
 by slaves of Rome
constructed,
enters into our days.

When in mounds of books,
 where verse lies buried,
you discover by chance the iron filings of lines,
touch them
 with respect,
 as you would
some antique
yet awesome weapon.

It’s no habit of mine
 to caress
 the ear
with words;
a maiden’s ear
 curly-ringed
will not crimson
 when flicked by smut.

In parade deploying
 the armies of my pages,
I shall inspect
the regiments in line.

Heavy as lead,
 my verses at attention stand,
ready for death
 and for immortal fame.

The poems are rigid,
pressing muzzle
to muzzle their gaping
 pointed titles.

The favorite 
of all the armed forces
the cavalry of witticisms
 ready
to launch a wild hallooing charge,
reins its chargers still,
 raising
the pointed lances of the rhymes.
and all
 these troops armed to the teeth,
which have flashed by
 victoriously for twenty years,
all these,
 to their very last page,
I present to you,
 the planet’s proletarian.

The enemy
of the massed working class
is my enemy too
inveterate and of long standing.

Years of trial
 and days of hunger
ordered us
to march 
 under the red flag.

We opened
 each volume
 of Marx
as we would open
the shutters
 in our own house;
but we did not have to read
 to make up our minds
which side to join,
which side to fight on.

Our dialectics
 were not learned
from Hegel.
In the roar of battle
it erupted into verse,
when,
 under fire,
 the bourgeois decamped
as once we ourselves
 had fled
 from them.
Let fame
trudge
after genius
like an inconsolable widow
to a funeral march - 
die then, my verse,
die like a common soldier,
like our men
 who nameless died attacking!
I don’t care a spit
 for tons of bronze;
I don’t care a spit
for slimy marble.
We’re men ofkind,
we’ll come to terms about our fame;
let our
common monument be
socialism
 built
 in battle.
Men of posterity
examine the flotsam of dictionaries:
out of Lethe
will bob up
the debris of such words
as “prostitution,” 
“tuberculosis,” 
“blockade.” 
For you,
 who are now
 healthy and agile,
the poet
with the rough tongue
 of his posters,
has licked away consumptives’ spittle.
With the tail of my years behind me,
I begin to resemble
those monsters,
 excavated dinosaurs.
Comrade life,
 let us
march faster,
march
faster through what’s left
 of the five-year plan.
My verse
has brought me
no rubles to spare:
no craftsmen have made
 mahogany chairs for my house.
In all conscience,
 I need nothing
except
a freshly laundered shirt.
When I appear 
 before the CCC
of the coming
bright years,
by way of my Bolshevik party card,
I’ll raise
above the heads
of a gang of self-seeking
 poets and rogues,
all the hundred volumes
 of my 
 communist-committed books.


>> Conversation with Comrade Lenin

Awhirl with events,
packed with jobs one too many,
the day slowly sinks
 as the night shadows fall.
There are two in the room:
Iand Lenin-
a photograph
on the whiteness of wall.

The stubble slides upward
above his lip
as his mouth
jerks open in speech.
Thetense
creases of brow
hold thought
in their grip,
immense brow
 matched by thought immense.
A forest of flags,
 raised-up hands thick as grass...
Thousands are marching
beneath him...
 Transported,
alight with joy,
I rise from my place,
eager to see him,
 hail him,
 report to him!
“ComradeLenin,
 I report to you -
(not a dictate of office,
 the heart’s prompting alone)

This hellish work
that we’re out to do

will be done
 andis already being done.
Wefeed and we clothe
and give light to the needy,

the quotas
 for coal
 and for iron
fulfill,
but there is
 any amount
 of bleeding
muck
andrubbish
aroundus still.

Without you,
 there’s many
have got out of hand,

all the sparring
 andsquabbling
 does one in.
There’s scum
 in plenty
hounding our land,

outside the borders
andalso
within.

Try to count ’em
and tab ’em - 
it’s no go,

there’s all kinds,
andthey’re
thick as nettles:
kulaks,
red tapists,
and,
down the row,
drunkards,
 sectarians,
 lickspittles.
They strut around
 proudly
as peacocks,
badges and fountain pens
studding their chests.
We’ll lick the lot of ’em-
 but
to lick ’em
is no easy job
 at the very best.
On snow-covered lands
 and on stubbly fields,
in smoky plants
and on factory sites,
with you in our hearts,
 ComradeLenin,
webuild,
wethink,
we breathe,
welive,
and we fight!”
Awhirl with events,
packed with jobs one too many,
the day slowly sinks
as the night shadows fall.
There are two in the room:
I
and Lenin - 
a photograph
on the whiteness of wall.

>> My Soviet Passport

I'd tear
 like a wolf
at bureaucracy.
For mandates
 my respect's but the slightest.
To the devil himself
 I'd chuck without mercy
every red-taped paper.
 But this ...
Down the long front
 of coupés and cabins
File the officials
 politely.
They gather up passports
 and I give in
My own vermilion booklet.
For one kind of passport -
smiling lips part
For others -
 an attitude scornful.
They take
 with respect, for instance,
the passport
From a sleeping-car
English Lionel.
The good fellows eyes
 almost slip like pips
when,
 bowing as low as men can,
they take,
 as if they were taking a tip,
the passport
 from an American.
At the Polish,
 they dolefully blink and wheeze
in dumb
 police elephantism -
where are they from,
 and what are these
geographical novelties?
And without a turn
 of their cabbage heads,
their feelings
 hidden in lower regions,
they take without blinking,
 the passports from Swedes
and various
 old Norwegians.
Then sudden
 as if their mouths were
 aquake
those gentlemen almost
 whine
Those very official gentlemen
 take
that red-skinned passport
 of mine.
Take-
 like a bomb
 take - like a hedgehog,
like a razor
 double-edge stropped,
take -
 like a rattlesnake huge and long
with at least
 20 fangs
poison-tipped.
The porter's eyes
 give a significant flick
(I'll carry your baggage
 for nix,
mon ami...)
The gendarmes enquiringly
 look at the tec,
the tec, -
 at the gendarmerie.
With what delight
 that gendarme caste
would have me
 strung-up and whipped raw
because I hold
 in my hands
hammered-fast
sickle-clasped
 my red Soviet passport.
I'd tear
 like a wolf
at bureaucracy.
For mandates
 my respect's but the slightest.
To the devil himself
 I'd chuck
without mercy
every red-taped paper,
 But this ...
I pull out
 of my wide trouser-pockets
duplicate
of a priceless cargo.
You now:
read this
 and envy,
I'm a citizen
of the Soviet Socialist Union!
