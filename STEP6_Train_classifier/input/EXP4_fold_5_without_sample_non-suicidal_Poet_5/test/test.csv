 and they died without even shedding green blood before they return to the soil they change to the color of soil,non-suicidal

 whether the dollar goes down or the yen goes up It's nice if there is a report of an interesting murder There is even a smell of religion in the human behavior called murder There is no chance of a drama exactly like sex being born in the Holocaust,non-suicidal
