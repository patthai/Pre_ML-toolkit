 Then sits Back. fat jug Contemplating a world clear as water. A red Shred in his little fist.,suicidal
 ROWING A story. a story! (Let it go. Let it come.) I was stamped out like a Plymouth fender into this world.,suicidal
 First came the crib with it’s glacial bars. Then dolls and the devotion to their plastic mouths. Then there was school.,suicidal
 the little straight rows of chairs. blotting my name over and over. but undersea all the time. a stranger whose elbows wouldn’t work. Then there was life,suicidal
 with it’s cruel houses and people who seldom touched – though touch is all – but I grew. like a pig in a trenchcoat I grew.,suicidal
 and then there were many strange apparitions. the nagging rain. the sun turning into poison and all of that. saws working through my heart. but I grew. I grew. and God was there like an island I had not rowed to.,suicidal
 still ignorant of Him. my arms and my legs worked. and I grew. I grew. I wore rubies and bought tomatoes and now. in my middle age. about nineteen in the head I’d say.,suicidal
 I am rowing. I am rowing though the oarlocks stick and are rusty and the sea blinks and rolls like a worried eyeball. but I am rowing. I am rowing.,suicidal
 though the wind pushes me back and I know that that island will not be perfect. it will have the flaws of life. the absurdities of the dinner table. but there will be a door,suicidal
 and I will open it and I will get rid of the rat inside of me. the gnawing pestilential rat. God will take it with his two hands and embrace it.,suicidal
 As the African says: This is my tale which I have told. if it be sweet. if it be not sweet. take somewhere else and let some return to me. This story ends with me still rowing.,suicidal
 I’m mooring my rowboat at the dock of the island called God. This dock is made in the shape of a fish and there are many boats moored at many different docks.,suicidal
 “It’s okay.” I say to myself. with blisters that broke and healed and broke and healed – saving themselves over and over. And salt sticking to my face and arms like,suicidal
 a glue-skin pocked with grains of tapioca. I empty myself from my wooden boat and onto the flesh of The Island. “On with it!” He says and thus we squat on the rocks by the sea,suicidal
 and play – can it be true – a game of poker. He calls me. I win because I hold a royal straight flush. He wins because He holds five aces.,suicidal
 A wild card had been announced but I had not heard it being in such a state of awe when He took out the cards and dealt. As he plunks down His five aces,suicidal
 and I am still grinning at my royal flush. He starts to laugh. and laughter rolling like a hoop out of His mouth and into mine. and such laughter that He doubles right over me,suicidal
 laughing a Rejoice-Chorus at our two triumphs. Then I laugh. the fishy dock laughs the sea laughs. The Island laughs. The Absurd laughs. Dearest dealer.,suicidal
 I with my royal straight flush. love you so for your wild card. that untamable. eternal. gut-driven ha-ha and lucky love.,suicidal

 “The windows. the starving windows that drive the trees like nails into my heart.”,suicidal
 “If I could blame it on all the mothers and fathers of the world. they of the lessons. the pellets of power. they of the love surrounding you like batter ... Blame it on God perhaps?,suicidal
 He of the first opening that pushed us all into our first mistakes? No. I'll blame it on Man For Man is God and man is eating the earth up,suicidal
 like a candy bar and not one of them can be left alone with the ocean for it is known he will gulp it all down. The stars (possibly) are safe. At least for the moment.,suicidal
 The stars are pears that no one can reach. even for a wedding. Perhaps for a death.”,suicidal
 “God went out of me as if the sea dried up like sandpaper. as if the sun became a latrine. God went out of my fingers. They became stone.,suicidal
 My body became a side of mutton and despair roamed the slaughterhouse.”,suicidal
