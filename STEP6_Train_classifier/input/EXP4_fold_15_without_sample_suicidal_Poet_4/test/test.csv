 and more charm. But I subdued myself. setting my heel,suicidal
 on the throat of my own song. Listen. comrades of posterity. to the agitator,suicidal
 the rabble-rouser. Stifling the torrents of poetry. I’ll skip the volumes of lyrics;,suicidal
 as one alive. I’ll address the living. I’ll join you in the far communist future. I who am,suicidal
 no Esenin super-hero. My verse will reach you across the peaks of ages. over the heads of governments and poets.,suicidal
 My verse will reach you not as an arrow in a cupid-lyred chase. not as worn penny,suicidal
 Reaches a numismatist. not as the light of dead stars reaches you. My verse by labor will break the mountain chain of years.,suicidal
 and will present itself ponderous. crude. tangible. as an aqueduct.,suicidal
 by slaves of Rome constructed. enters into our days. When in mounds of books. where verse lies buried.,suicidal
 you discover by chance the iron filings of lines. touch them with respect. as you would some antique,suicidal
 yet awesome weapon. It’s no habit of mine to caress the ear with words;,suicidal
 a maiden’s ear curly-ringed will not crimson when flicked by smut. In parade deploying,suicidal
 the armies of my pages. I shall inspect the regiments in line. Heavy as lead. my verses at attention stand.,suicidal
 ready for death and for immortal fame. The poems are rigid. pressing muzzle to muzzle their gaping,suicidal
 pointed titles. The favorite of all the armed forces the cavalry of witticisms ready,suicidal
 to launch a wild hallooing charge. reins its chargers still. raising the pointed lances of the rhymes. and all,suicidal
 these troops armed to the teeth. which have flashed by victoriously for twenty years. all these. to their very last page.,suicidal
 I present to you. the planet’s proletarian. The enemy of the massed working class is my enemy too,suicidal
 inveterate and of long standing. Years of trial and days of hunger ordered us to march,suicidal
 under the red flag. We opened each volume of Marx as we would open,suicidal
 the shutters in our own house; but we did not have to read to make up our minds which side to join.,suicidal
 which side to fight on. Our dialectics were not learned from Hegel. In the roar of battle,suicidal
 it erupted into verse. when. under fire. the bourgeois decamped as once we ourselves,suicidal
 had fled from them. Let fame trudge after genius,suicidal
 like an inconsolable widow to a funeral march - die then. my verse. die like a common soldier. like our men,suicidal
 who nameless died attacking! I don’t care a spit for tons of bronze; I don’t care a spit for slimy marble.,suicidal
 We’re men ofkind. we’ll come to terms about our fame; let our common monument be socialism,suicidal
 built in battle. Men of posterity examine the flotsam of dictionaries: out of Lethe,suicidal
 will bob up the debris of such words as “prostitution.” “tuberculosis.” “blockade.”,suicidal
 For you. who are now healthy and agile. the poet with the rough tongue,suicidal
 of his posters. has licked away consumptives’ spittle. With the tail of my years behind me. I begin to resemble those monsters.,suicidal
 excavated dinosaurs. Comrade life. let us march faster. march,suicidal
 faster through what’s left of the five-year plan. My verse has brought me no rubles to spare:,suicidal
 no craftsmen have made mahogany chairs for my house. In all conscience. I need nothing except,suicidal
 a freshly laundered shirt. When I appear before the CCC of the coming bright years.,suicidal
 by way of my Bolshevik party card. I’ll raise above the heads of a gang of self-seeking poets and rogues.,suicidal
 all the hundred volumes of my communist-committed books.,suicidal
 Awhirl with events. packed with jobs one too many. the day slowly sinks as the night shadows fall. There are two in the room:,suicidal
 Iand Lenin- a photograph on the whiteness of wall. The stubble slides upward above his lip,suicidal
 as his mouth jerks open in speech. Thetense creases of brow hold thought,suicidal
 in their grip. immense brow matched by thought immense. A forest of flags. raised-up hands thick as grass...,suicidal
 Thousands are marching beneath him... Transported. alight with joy. I rise from my place.,suicidal
 eager to see him. hail him. report to him! “ComradeLenin. I report to you -,suicidal
 (not a dictate of office. the heart’s prompting alone) This hellish work that we’re out to do will be done,suicidal
 andis already being done. Wefeed and we clothe and give light to the needy. the quotas for coal,suicidal
 and for iron fulfill. but there is any amount of bleeding,suicidal
 muck andrubbish aroundus still. Without you. there’s many,suicidal
 have got out of hand. all the sparring andsquabbling does one in. There’s scum,suicidal
 in plenty hounding our land. outside the borders andalso within.,suicidal
 Try to count ’em and tab ’em - it’s no go. there’s all kinds. andthey’re,suicidal
 thick as nettles: kulaks. red tapists. and. down the row.,suicidal
 drunkards. sectarians. lickspittles. They strut around proudly,suicidal
 as peacocks. badges and fountain pens studding their chests. We’ll lick the lot of ’em- but,suicidal
 to lick ’em is no easy job at the very best. On snow-covered lands and on stubbly fields.,suicidal
 in smoky plants and on factory sites. with you in our hearts. ComradeLenin. webuild.,suicidal
 wethink. we breathe. welive. and we fight!” Awhirl with events.,suicidal
 packed with jobs one too many. the day slowly sinks as the night shadows fall. There are two in the room: I,suicidal
 and Lenin - a photograph on the whiteness of wall.,suicidal
 I'd tear like a wolf at bureaucracy. For mandates my respect's but the slightest.,suicidal
 To the devil himself I'd chuck without mercy every red-taped paper. But this ... Down the long front,suicidal
 of coupés and cabins File the officials politely. They gather up passports and I give in,suicidal
 My own vermilion booklet. For one kind of passport - smiling lips part For others - an attitude scornful.,suicidal
 They take with respect. for instance. the passport From a sleeping-car English Lionel.,suicidal
 The good fellows eyes almost slip like pips when. bowing as low as men can. they take.,suicidal
 as if they were taking a tip. the passport from an American. At the Polish. they dolefully blink and wheeze,suicidal
 in dumb police elephantism - where are they from. and what are these geographical novelties?,suicidal
 And without a turn of their cabbage heads. their feelings hidden in lower regions. they take without blinking.,suicidal
 the passports from Swedes and various old Norwegians. Then sudden as if their mouths were,suicidal
 aquake those gentlemen almost whine Those very official gentlemen take,suicidal
 that red-skinned passport of mine. Take- like a bomb take - like a hedgehog.,suicidal
 like a razor double-edge stropped. take - like a rattlesnake huge and long with at least,suicidal
 20 fangs poison-tipped. The porter's eyes give a significant flick (I'll carry your baggage,suicidal
 for nix. mon ami...) The gendarmes enquiringly look at the tec. the tec. -,suicidal
 at the gendarmerie. With what delight that gendarme caste would have me strung-up and whipped raw,suicidal
 because I hold in my hands hammered-fast sickle-clasped my red Soviet passport.,suicidal
 I'd tear like a wolf at bureaucracy. For mandates my respect's but the slightest.,suicidal
 To the devil himself I'd chuck without mercy every red-taped paper. But this ...,suicidal
 I pull out of my wide trouser-pockets duplicate of a priceless cargo. You now:,suicidal
 That is one line in a long tragic play That has been acted many times before. And acted best when not a single tear Falls.- when the mind and not the heart holds sway.,suicidal
 Past one o’clock you're probably in bed The Milky Way is like Oka of silver No need for me to rush I have no reasons left to stir you with the lightnings of my cable fever And so they say the incident dissolved*,suicidal
 the love boat smashed up on the dreary routine We’re even there’s no use in keeping the score of mutual hurts affliction and spleen Look here the world exudes an eerie calm The night demands tribute in constellations,suicidal
 in hours like these I’d like to be the one with ages history and the creation,suicidal
 My most respected comrades of posterity! Rummaging among these days’ petrified crap.,suicidal
 exploring the twilight of our times. you. possibly. will inquire about me too. And. possibly. your scholars,suicidal
 will declare. with their erudition overwhelming a swarm of problems; once there lived a certain champion of boiled water.,suicidal
 and inveterate enemy of raw water. Professor. take off your bicycle glasses! I myself will expound those times,suicidal
 and myself. I. a latrine cleaner and water carrier. by the revolution mobilized and drafted.,suicidal
 went off to the front from the aristocratic gardens of poetry - the capricious wench She planted a delicious garden.,suicidal
 the daughter. cottage. pond and meadow. Myself a garden I did plant.,suicidal
 myself with water sprinkled it. some pour their verse from water cans; others spit water from their mouth - the curly Macks.,suicidal
 the clever jacks - but what the hell’s it all about! There’s no damming al this up - beneath the walls they mandoline: “Tara-tina. tara-tine.,suicidal
 tw-a-n-g...” It’s no great honor. then. for my monuments to rise from such roses above the public squares.,suicidal
 where consumption coughs. where whores. hooligans and syphilis walk. Agitprop sticks,suicidal
 in my teeth too. and I’d rather compose romances for you - more profit in it,suicidal
